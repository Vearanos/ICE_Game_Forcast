# ICE Game Forecast: Predicting Game Success

This project aims to forecast the potential success of video games in 2017 based on data from 2016. The goal is to identify which games are likely to perform well, allowing for strategic advertising and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

The core idea behind this project is to leverage historical data to predict future trends. By analyzing game performance metrics from 2016, we can build a model that identifies key indicators of success and uses them to forecast the potential of games released or continuing to be popular in 2017.

## Key Objectives

*   **Data Analysis:** Analyze game data from 2016, including sales figures, player engagement, critical reception, and other relevant metrics.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Identify and engineer features that are strong predictors of game success.
*   **Model Development:** Develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the success of games in 2017.
*   **Success Metrics:** Define clear metrics for what constitutes "success" (e.g., sales, player base, critical acclaim).
*   **Game Prioritization:** Use the model's predictions to prioritize games for advertising and marketing efforts.
* **Evaluation:** Evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions against actual 2017 data.

## Potential Data Sources

*   **Game Sales Data:** Data from platforms like Steam, console marketplaces, and other retailers.
*   **Player Engagement Data:** Information on player counts, playtime, and other engagement metrics.
*   **Critical Reception:** Review scores and other critical feedback from gaming publications.
*   **Social Media Data:** Trends and sentiment analysis from social media platforms.

## Technologies Used (To be filled in as the project progresses)

*   **Programming Languages:** (e.g., Python, R)
*   **Data Analysis Libraries:** (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
*   **Machine Learning Frameworks:** (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   **Data Visualization Tools:** (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **Database:** (e.g. SQL, NoSQL)

## Getting Started

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Gather the necessary game data from the identified sources.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to understand its characteristics and identify potential patterns.
4.  **Model Building:** Develop and train the predictive model.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Test the model's accuracy and refine it as needed.
6. **Deployment:** (Optional) Deploy the model to provide predictions on new games.
